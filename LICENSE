which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

Eclipse Public License 1.0
(@zowe/perf-timing 1.0.7)

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
==============================

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and
sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such
as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after
the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
==============================

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.


1. DEFINITIONS
--------------

"Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed
  under this Agreement, and
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

    i) changes to the Program, and
    ii) additions to the Program;

  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
  Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a
  Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
  acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or
  additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any
Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form,
that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial
revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results
from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the
Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that
contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that
contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of
the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass
the Program or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any
manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and
configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or
any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional
permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.


2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
------------------

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
  such Derivative Works.
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
  Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
  transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other
  form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution
  and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
  its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
  to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
  Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
  license before distributing the Program.
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
  copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
  set forth in this Agreement.
  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes
  additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this
  Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the
  terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).


3. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with
  section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement
  that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and
  informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
  medium customarily used for software exchange; and
  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than
  this Agreement, provided that such license:

    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties
    and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
    title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
    merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source
    Code under section 3.2; and
    iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be
    under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program

    (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
    available under a Secondary License, and
    (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described
    in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under
    the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark,
attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability
('notices') contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they
Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.


4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.


5. NO WARRANTY
--------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.


6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
--------------------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


7. GENERAL
----------

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a
Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under
this Agreement.


Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
---------------------------------------------

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary
Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse
Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and
exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not
  sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
  then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
  relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
  notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

The GNU General Public License (GPL)
====================================


Version 2, June 1991
--------------------

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
    Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
    also meet all of these conditions:

      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
        in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
        be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
        of this License.

      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
        Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
    the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
        Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies the executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
    object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
    cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
    consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
    body of this License.

  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type 'show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program 'Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
of this License.

Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement
(picomatch 2.3.1)

The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement
==========================================================

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document. You may use content from this license document as source material for
your own license agreement, but you may not use the name "Hacktivismo
Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement ," ("HESSLA") or any confusingly
similar name, trademark or service-mark, in connection with any license agreement
that is not either (1) a verbatim copy of this License Agreement, or (2) a
license agreement that contains only additional terms expressly permitted by The
HESSLA.

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

Software that Hacktivismo[fn1] releases under this License Agreement is intended
to promote our political objectives. And, likewise, the purpose of this License
Agreement itself is political: Namely, to compliment the software's intended
political function. Hacktivismo itself exists to develop and deploy computer
software technologies that promote fundamental human rights of end-users.
Hacktivismo also seeks to enlist the active participation and involvement of
people around the world, to help us improve these software tools, and to take
other actions (including actions that involve using and distributing our
software, and the advancement of similarly-minded software projects of others)
that promote human rights and freedom worldwide.

  [fn1] http://hacktivismo.com/

Because of our non-commercial objective of promoting end-users' freedoms,
Hacktivismo has some special, and admittedly ambitious, licensing needs. This
License Agreement enhances the benefits of published source code by backing up
our human rights projects with appropriate remedies enforceable in court.

The Freedoms We Promote: When we speak of the freedom of end-users, we are
talking about basic freedoms recognized in the Hacktivismo Declaration,[fn2] the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[fn3] the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,[fn4] and other documents that recognize and promote
freedom and human dignity. Principal among these freedoms are:

  [fn2] http://hacktivismo.com/about/declarations/
  [fn3] http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm
  [fn4] http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html

Freedom of Expression: The freedom of opinion and expression "include[s] freedom
to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of
frontiers,"[fn5] and the freedom to choose one's own medium of expression. The
arbitrary use of technological censorship measures to block or prevent access to
broad categories of speech and expression including the work of critics,
intellectuals, artists, journalists, and religious figures is seldom, if ever,
justified by any legitimate governmental objective. And, to the extent that
technology enables censorship decisions to be removed from public scrutiny and
review, technology-based censorship mechanisms are especially suspect and
dangerous to civil society. When repressive governments and other institutions of
power seek to deprive people of this basic freedom, people have the right to
secure, employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which
they are justifiably entitled.

  [fn5] Article 19, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Freedom of Collective Action and Association: People have and should have the
"freedom of peaceful assembly and association."[fn6] This freedom includes the
right of people to work together to secure constructive change in their personal,
economic, and political circumstances. When repressive governments or other
institutions of power seek to deprive people (including users of the Internet) of
their freedoms of voluntary assembly, association, and common enterprise, people
have the right to secure, employ and deploy technologies that reclaim the
freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled.

  [fn6] Article 20(1), Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Freedoms of Thought, Conscience, Sexuality, and Religion: People have and should
have the freedom of "thought, conscience, and religion."[fn7] This right
"includes freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in
community with others, in public or private, to manifest any religion or belief
in teaching, practice, worship and observance, regardless of doctrine."[fn8]
Every person, regardless of sex or sexual preference, and with reciprocal respect
for the corresponding rights of all others, has and should have the right to
determine and choose, freely and without coercion, whether, how and with whom he
or she shall fully enjoy the most private and personal aspects of human life,
including individual sexuality, reproduction, and fertility. Moreover, "[t]he
explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women to control all
aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is basic to their
empowerment."[fn9] When repressive governments and other institutions of power
seek to deprive people of these basic freedoms, they have the right to secure,
employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which they are
justifiably entitled.

  [fn7] Article 18, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
  [fn8] Id.
  [fn9] Paragraph 17, Beijing Declaration of the Fourth United Nations Conference
  on Women (Sept. 15, 1995).

Freedom of Privacy: Every person has the right to be free from "subject[ion] to
arbitrary interference with his [or her] privacy, family, home or
correspondence"[fn10] -- digitally, or by any other means or methodology. This
freedom of privacy includes the right to be free from governmental or private
surveillance that might interfere with or deter the rightful exercise of any
other freedoms of any person. In the context of software tools that enable people
to reclaim their freedoms, all end-users have and should have the right to secure
and use tools that are free from the surreptitious insertion into their software
of "backdoors," "spy-ware," escrow mechanisms, or other code or techniques that
might promote surveillance, or subvert security (including cryptographic
security), confidentiality, anonymity, authenticity and/or trust.

  [fn10] Article 12, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Reasons For Enhancing "Free" and "Open-Source" Licensing: Developing a new
software license is never a trivial task and this License Agreement has presented
special challenges for Hacktivismo. Because of our human rights objectives, this
License Agreement includes some specific terms and conditions that, as a
technical matter, depart from the previously-recognized and established
definitions of "free"[fn11] software and "open source"[fn12] software.

  [fn11] http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
  [fn12] http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php

We have therefore coined the term "enhanced source" to describe this License
Agreement because we have sought to combine most of the freedom-promoting
benefits of "free" or "open-source" software (including mandatory disclosure of
any changes or modifications Licensees make to the source code, whenever they
release modified versions of HESSLA-licensed Programs or other Derivative Works),
with additional enhanced license and contractual terms that are intended to
promote the freedom of end-users. The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software
License Agreement promotes our objectives in an enhanced manner by including
contractual terms that empower both Hacktivismo and qualified end-users with
greater flexibility and leverage to maintain and recover human rights, through
the mechanism of the contract itself including terms that are designed to enhance
both our enforcement posture and that of qualified end-users in court.

To be sure, Hacktivismo enthusiastically endorses and supports the goals and
objectives of the Free Software movement and those of the open source community.
In particular, we owe a special debt of gratitude to the Free Software
Foundation, to the Open Source Initiative, and to many exceedingly talented
people who have contributed to Free Software and open source projects and
endeavors over the years.

Ultimately, however, after reviewing the field of possibilities among
previously-existing "open source" and "free" licenses, Hacktivismo has concluded
that none of them fully meets our requirements. Writing our own License Agreement
enables us to pursue our human rights objectives more effectively. This licensing
endeavor represents a first step toward achieving our objectives, and no doubt
informed feedback, scholarship, and learned commentary will enable us to pursue
our objectives even more effectively in the future.

Benefits That Carry Over From Free Software: Before we explain how an "enhanced
source" License Agreement specifically differs from a "free" or "open source"
license, we believe it is helpful to explain in greater detail what the principal
advantages, and freedom-enhancing aspects, of "free" software are.

When we speak of "free software," we refer to important personal freedoms, and
not price. In addition to terms that are intended to promote the freedoms of
Expression, Thought, Collective Action and Privacy (along with other human
rights) of all end-users, the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License
Agreement is also designed and intended to promote the following freedoms:

  * You have the freedom to distribute copies of the software (and charge for
    this service if You wish);

  * You have the freedom of access to the source code, to inspect and verify (and
    even to improve, if You can) the integrity and functionality of the software;

  * So long as You do not subvert or infringe the freedoms of end-users by doing
    so, You have the freedom to change the software or to use parts of it in new
    Programs;

  * You have the freedom to know You can do these things.

The licenses for most computer software programs are designed to take away Your
freedom to share software or change source code. This kind of software is
designated as proprietary or "closed." The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software
License Agreement -- like other license agreements that have served as
inspiration for our work -- is intended to promote both Your freedom to share our
software with others, and Your freedom to change and improve the software. Your
right under this License Agreement to look at the source not only enables You to
contribute Your own efforts to Hacktivismo's human rights projects, but also
serves as an additional level of assurance to You as an end-user that unwelcome,
hidden surprises have not been inserted into the software, that could compromise
Your rights and freedoms when You use the software.

HESSLA Helps Safeguard Additional End-User Freedoms: In order to understand why
this License Agreement must be described as "enhanced source," and cannot
strictly speaking be considered either a "free" or "open source" license
agreement, it is helpful to consider the possibility that a programmer might
insert malicious code, such as a computer virus, a keystroke logger, or "spyware"
into a program that has previously been released under a "free software" license
agreement.[fn13] The act of inserting malicious code into software, if done by a
private individual or company (though many governments will contend they are not
required to play by the same rules as the rest of us), may well violate criminal
laws and result in civil tort liability. It is, of course, also possible to deter
such malicious behavior by including, in a software license agreement, a specific
contractual term that prohibits such behavior meaning that any licensee who
violates the prohibition against malicious code can be sued by the licensor (or
by third-party beneficiaries who the licensor has explicitly identified as
alternate or additional enforcers of the agreement) for money damages and a court
order forbidding any continued violation.

  [fn13]In this regard, a the following hypothetical illustration should be
  particularly helpful. If an organization of computer security enthusiasts
  were to release, under the GNU General Public License ("GPL"), a program
  called "Grey Eminence 3000" ("GE3K") a remote-administration tool for
  Microsoft Windows, that helps illustrate how insecure this particular
  commercial product happens to be it should hardly be surprising that the
  United States Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation, after
  making some loud and misleading apocalyptic noises about "computer hackers"
  to Congress and in the media (primarily in a largely successful effort to
  increase their technology budgets), would also study the software to see what
  it does, how it does it, and whether any of those capabilities happen to be
  features that law enforcement might find helpful. Of course, if the U.S.
  federal law enforcement community were to announce, several months later,
  that it had commissioned the development of "classified" quasi-viral
  computer-intrusion and surveillance software called "Magic Candle" the
  capabilities of which law enforcement does not plan to disclose to the
  public, and the source code for which will remain a closely-guarded secret
  then inquiring minds might become curious as to whether "Magic Candle"
  contains any of the GPLed code that was written for "GE3K" (or any other free
  or open-source software, for that matter). Needless to say, under the right
  factual circumstances, if any GPLed code from GE3K found its way into "Magic
  Candle," then the U.S. government or its software development contractor
  might well be obligated to reveal to the public all the source code for
  "Magic Candle." Nevertheless, so long as the "Magic Candle" source is never
  publicly released for comparison purposes, then everyone with legitimate
  questions about GPL compliance faces a chicken-and-egg problem. So long as
  the source of "Magic Candle" remains secret, detection of a GPL violation
  becomes dramatically more difficult (particularly so if, additionally, nobody
  outside law enforcement has access to the compiled executables), which means
  the worldwide community of Internet users and software developers has only
  the United States government's solemn assurance that no GE3K code was used
  cold comfort at best.

Previous Licenses Provide More Limited Protection Against Government and Other
Surveillance: No software license agreement that qualifies as "free" or "open
source" may contain any restriction as a term of the license agreement that in
any way qualifies any Licensee's prerogative (no matter who they are or what
their motives may be) to make changes to code. In other words, an "open source"
license agreement, to qualify for the "open source" label, may not even contain a
term that prohibits the insertion of destructive viruses or "trojan horses" into
derivative code. Likewise, no "free" or "open source" license agreement can in
any way contain (as a license term) any restriction on the use of software not
even a prohibition against unlawful surveillance or other malicious uses of the
software.

The "open source" and "Free Software" communities rely principally on voluntary
compliance[fn14] with the disclosure provisions of license agreements (although
many "free" and "open source" license agreements, such as BSD-style licenses, do
not require changed code to be disclosed, and in fact enable modified versions of
programs to be "taken proprietary") and on social mechanisms of enforcement, as
means to detect, prevent, deter, and remedy abuses.

  [fn14]As the example in Note 13 illustrates, it is sometimes difficult to
  determine whether the source disclosure requirement of the GPL has been
  violated, such as when a modified version of a program has been distributed
  without source, precisely because detection of a disclosure violation depends
  in part on the disclosure of the source of derivative works in order to
  compare whether a putative derivative really does contain code derived from a
  GPLed parent work.

The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement does not in any way
sacrifice or surrender the enforcement techniques and safeguards available under
license agreements such as the GNU General Public License. Rather, the HESSLA
enhances the options available to Hacktivismo and to qualified end-users, by
providing additional enforcement options. Moreover, for the purpose of promoting
the freedoms of both programers and end-users, through the enforced mandatory
disclosure of code modified by third-parties, this License Agreement has
advantages over many of the licenses (such as BSD-style licenses) that fully
qualify as "free" or "open-source" license agreements.

What makes this License Agreement an "enhanced source" License Agreement, instead
of a "free software" license agreement, is that the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source
Software License Agreement contains specific, very limited restrictions on
modification and use of software by Licensees, as part of a calculated trade-off
of rights and responsibilities that is intended to promote the freedom of
end-users.

The Enhanced-Source Bargain Reinforces End-User Freedoms: To protect Your rights,
we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny You specific rights or to
ask You to surrender these rights. To protect Your human rights as an end-user of
this program or any work based on it, we need to make restrictions that forbid
You and all other Licensees of this software (including, without limitation, any
government Licensees) from using this code to subvert the human rights of any
end-user.

We protect Your rights and the rights of all end-users with two steps: (1)
copyright the software, and (2) offer You this License Agreement which gives You
qualified legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

The restrictions shared by all Licensees translate into certain responsibilities
for You and for everyone else (including governmental entities everywhere) if You
distribute copies of the software, if You use it, or if You modify it.

In this regard, the methodology we employ is not materially different from the
methodology Free Software Foundation employs in the GNU General Public License
(the "GPL"). The methodology is to exchange the Author's permission to copy,
change, and/or distribute a copyrighted work, for every Licensee's acceptance of
terms and conditions that promote the licensor's objectives. In both this License
Agreement and the GPL, the terms and conditions that each Licensee must accept
are intended to discriminate against certain very narrow, limited kinds of human
endeavor, that are inconsistent with the licensor's political objectives. In
other words, the GPL requires each Licensee to promise not to engage in the
activity of 'propertizing,' or 'taking proprietary,' modifications to GPLed code;
modified code must also be released under the GPL, and cannot be released in the
form of "closed" executables, or otherwise be made "proprietary." Likewise, the
Hacktivismo Enhanced Source Software License Agreement discriminates against
undesirable activity such as surveillance, introduction of certain kinds of
malicious code, and human rights violations, as well as discriminating against
"propertizing" behavior such as might violate the GPL. Subject to these narrow
restrictions, Licensees under either license agreement enjoy very broad latitude
to change, use, explore, modify, and distribute the software much broader than
they would enjoy with typical "proprietary" software packages.

As with "copyleft" licenses such as the GPL, under the Hacktivismo Enhanced
Source Software License Agreement, programmers (including, most importantly,
programmers working for governments) do not have unfettered or completely
unlimited "freedom" for purposes of what they can do with HESSLA-licensed code.
Just as with the GPL, they do not have the "freedom" to convert HESSLA-licensed
code into "closed" or "proprietary" code. People who create derivative works
based on an HESSLA-licensed program and distribute those works have a
corresponding obligation to "give back," and not merely to "take,"
HESSLA-licensed code.

If You distribute copies of such an HESSLA-licensed program, whether gratis or
for a fee, You must give the recipients all the rights and responsibilities that
You have. You must ensure that they, too, are told of the terms of this License
Agreement, including the freedoms they have, and the kinds of uses and
modifications that are forbidden. You must communicate a copy of this License
Agreement to them as part of any copy, modification, or re-use of source or
object code, so they know their rights and responsibilities.

Thus, the main difference between this License Agreement and the GPL is not the
methodology we employ,[fn15] but the scope and breadth of the political
objectives we seek to promote. Simply put, the political objectives we promote
are somewhat broader than the explicit political goals that the Free Software
Foundation seeks to promote through the GPL. Our goals include a somewhat broader
range of human rights than the specific copyright-related rights with which the
GPL is principally concerned. But, while we are concerned with the entire field
of human rights rather than a subset, we want to make it perfectly clear that we
also embrace, share, and seek to promote, the goals we share with the Free
Software movement.

  [fn15] There is a modest difference, but it is not large, and mostly
  philosophical. Some experts on the GPL draw a distinction between a
  "contract" and a pure "license," by taking the position that a pure "license"
  does not impose "contractual" conditions on a Licensee only conditions that
  would otherwise (but for the license) be subsumed within with exclusive
  rights that the licensor has under copyright law. Thus, the licensor has the
  right to exclude anyone else from such activities as making copies, making
  derivative works, publicly performing a work, and other exclusive rights
  specified by statute. But, concerning the act of "using" a computer software
  program, in instances in which a copy is not made (or, in the trivial sense
  that a copy is made only temporarily from a storage medium to memory, to
  enable software to be "used"), the Free Software Foundation takes the
  position that United States law, at least, does not confer an exclusive right
  on the copyright holder (or, as others would argue, the United States statute
  qualifies the holder's exclusive right to copy),because the U.S. Copyright
  Act specifically exempts from the exclusive right to make copies, a copy made
  from (for example) a computer hard drive to volatile memory, in connection
  with the process of executing computer software. So far as we can determine,
  the Free Software Foundation does not argue that it is impossible
  "contractually" to impose conditions on use, as part of the bargain one
  strikes, when conditionally allowing Licensees to make copies of a program.
  Rather, for philosophical reasons, the Free Software Foundation voluntarily
  chooses not to include what it views as "contractual" conditions in the GPL.
  In this sense, Hactivismo takes the position that the HESSLA is clearly a
  "contract" and contains "contractual" terms, such that it should not be
  considered a "pure license," under the nomenclature employed by the Free
  Software Foundation. However, in our view, precisely because both the HESSLA
  and the GPL are clearly conditional grants of permission to do things from
  which the Licensee would otherwise be excluded (i.e., the Licensee must
  undertake certain obligations in exchange for permission to copy, modify, or
  distribute, a work), the key point is that the methodology is quite similar.

Compared with the GPL, aspects of the HESSLA give both end-users and programmers
(including, most importantly, governmental end-users and programmers) marginally
less leeway to make malicious use of the program, or to insert malicious code
into a program, than they would have under a traditional "copyleft" software
license. These aspects of the HESSLA (such as the requirement that the program
cannot be used to violate human rights, or forbidding the insertion of "spy-ware"
or surveillance mechanisms into derivative works) are included because our
ultimate objective is to preserve and promote the human rights of end-users,
including their privacy and their right of free expression.

In other words, unlike many programmers, we are not just in the business of
developing and distributing open-standards technologies. We're also trying to
empower end-users (including end-users in totalitarian regimes) with software
tools that promote fundamental freedoms while also seeking as best we can to
protect these end-users from being arrested, beaten, or worse. Our objective of
promoting end-user freedoms, including the freedoms of people in politically
repressive countries, is precisely the factor that has led Hacktivismo to develop
this License Agreement instead of using another.

The HESSLA Also Includes Features To Enhance Government Accountability: To this
end, we have sought and intend to ensure, to the fullest extent that law
(including, without limitation, the law of contract and of copyright licensing)
enables us to do so,[fn16] that no government or other institution may do
anything with this computer software or the underlying source code without
becoming a Licensee bound by the terms of this License Agreement, subject to the
same restrictions on modification and use as anyone else.

  [fn16] "Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent
  national tribunals for acts violating . . . fundamental rights . . ." Article
  8, United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

Accordingly, this License Agreement includes several terms that are aimed
explicitly at governmental entities, in order to maximize enforceability against
such entities. Respect for the Rule of Law means that no governmental entity is
above the law, and that no governmental entity should be permitted to use its
status as a mechanism for circumventing the requirements of this License
Agreement.

Any use, copying or modification of this software by any governmental official or
governmental entity anywhere in the world is a voluntary act, which act the
governmental official or entity is free to forego if it does not wish to be bound
by this License Agreement. This License Agreement seeks to establish as clearly
as possible two important checks on the improper use of government power. First,
the voluntary election to use, copy, or modify, this software by any government
or governmental official constitutes a waiver of all immunities that might
otherwise be asserted, against enforcement of this License Agreement by the
Author, or assertion by end-users or others of any human rights laws that may
have been violated by a government employing the Software. Second, any such
government or governmental official not only subjects itself to enforcement
action in its own courts, but also explicitly and voluntarily subjects itself to
enforcement action in the courts of other nations that are likely to be more
objective, for the purpose of giving effect to the terms of this License
Agreement.

Mechanism of Contract Acceptance: This License Agreement treats any use of the
software as acceptance of the terms of this License Agreement. To understand the
significance of this, it is important to distinguish between the law governing
copyright and the law governing offer and acceptance for the purpose of contract
formation (which gives the offeror the power to specify the manner of
acceptance). The question of whether copyright confers an exclusive right of use
on the author of a program is certainly an interesting one. Under United States
law, see 17 U.S.C. 117(a)(1), a limited exception to the exclusive right to copy
exists if one makes a second copy "created as an essential step in the
utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is
used in no other manner." This License Agreement presupposes that there is no
exclusive right to use in the Copyright Act, just an exclusive right to copy.
However, You may not make a copy for anyone else unless they are subject to the
terms of this License Agreement. Nor may You permit anyone to use Your copy or
any other copy You have made unless they are subject to the terms of this License
Agreement. You may not make a copy for Your own use or the use of anyone else
without the Author's leave to make that copy. And any use, modification, copying,
or distribution by anyone constitutes acceptance of the License Agreement, for
purposes of contract law. In other words, the License Agreement is designed so
that there is no loophole permitting anyone to claim the ability to use, copy,
distribute, or modify the Program or any Software based on it without subjecting
themselves voluntarily to its terms.

On "Shrinkwrap," "Click-Wrap," "Use-Wrap" and "Copy-Wrap" License Agreements:
Arguably, some kinds of software license agreements have more in common with
legislation than they do with the bargained-for, negotiated agreements that come
to mind when most people think of "contracts." Particularly if a software
licensor has sufficient market power to be deemed a monopoly, or if certain
proposed expansions of the law of software licensing, masquerading as
"codifications," are widely adopted, the ability of a private entity to impose
legal prohibitions and duties on virtually everyone else as though the licensor
has assumed powers that customarily belong to legislative bodies is both
breathtaking and deeply troubling. Of course, we are hardly the first to
distribute software under a license agreement that imposes conditions on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis. This technique is, as everyone knows, extremely common
with proprietary software. And some of the conditions unilaterally imposed by
proprietary licensors range from the ridiculous to the obscene. But even certain
kinds of "free" and "open-source" software licenses, such as the GPL, depend on
the continued viability of legal rules that enable at least some reasonable
conditions to be imposed by software licensors on a take-it-or-leave-it basis,
with essentially automated methods of acceptance. Courts have been divided as to
how far these kinds of licensor-driven automated agreements can go. And we cannot
say that we will be unhappy if courts or legislatures ultimately reach a
consensus that sharply limits what conditions licensors can impose through such
mechanisms. However, while the law is still developing, we think nothing could be
more appropriate than to enlist the techniques that institutions of power have
used to limit freedom and instead to re-purpose the techniques of "copy-wrap" or
"use-wrap" licensing by putting them to use for humanitarian purposes and using
them to promote the human rights of end-users. To deny us the use of these
techniques, courts and other law-making institutions would be required
simultaneously to disarm, to the same degree, proprietary software manufacturers
that possess vast market power. And, unlike the conditions imposed by many
proprietary vendors, the conditions we impose through this License Agreement are
hardly onerous for any end-user (unless, of course, the end-user wants to act
maliciously or engage in surveillance).

No Warranty: Next, for each author's protection and our own, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this software.
And, if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Software Patents: Software patents constantly threaten any project such as this
one. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a HESSLA-licensed program
will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have included terms by which any Author must, if
it has patented (or licensed a patent covering) any technology embodied in any
Program or Software released under this License Agreement, grant all HESSLA
Licensees of the Program or Software a royalty-free license of that technology.
Any Licensees who release derivative works, as permitted by this License
Agreement, are required to grant a royalty-free patent license of any patented
technology.

Anyone Can Release Original Software Under The HESSLA: Although this License
Agreement is drafted with Hacktivismo's objectives in mind, perhaps it will meet
other authors' needs as well. If You are considering using this License Agreement
for Your own software (meaning the code is not a work based on Hacktivismo's
program in which case all derivative works must be released under this License
Agreement but rather Your code is original software that You have developed
yourself) and if You have no special reason to prefer this License Agreement to
some license that has a more robust and widely-understood track-record, then in
most instances we encourage You to use the GPL (or, even better, release
concurrently under both the HESSLA and the GPL), because a considerable body of
interpretive literature and community custom has grown up around that License
Agreement. The Open Software License, see < http://www.rosenlaw.com/osl.html >,
is newer and has less of a track record. But You may also want to consider that
licensing option (as well as the option of concurrent OSL/HESSLA licensing).

Any author of original software can release that software under this License
Agreement, if You choose to do so; not just Hacktivismo. Hacktivismo is the
author and owner of software released by Hacktivismo under this License
Agreement. But original software released by other Authors would be owned and
licensed by them.

Ultimately, we think it is important to emphasize to other Authors that Programs
they have written can be released under both the HESSLA and some other license
simultaneously (for, example, a program that is presently GPLed by its Author can
be released simultaneously under both the GPL and the HESSLA, at the Author's
discretion). If You are an Author of original work, You need neither the
permission of the Free Software Foundation nor of Hacktivismo to elect to release
software simultaneously under both licenses. The advantage of such a voluntary
double-licensing is that it will enable developers to produce hybrid software
packages (combining the functionality available through, say, Hacktivismo's
Six-Four APIs, with some of the functionality of one or more popular GPL-licensed
communications programs) and to release the hybrid packages under the HESSLA,
without causing those developers to run afoul of the GPL, the HESSLA or both.
Such an arrangement maximizes the potential benefit to both the developer
community and to end-users worldwide. Software released under a BSD-style
license, as a general matter, can be used to produce a hybrid program, mixing
HESSLA-licensed code with code that was previously subject to a BSD license. The
HESSLA requires that, in such an instance, the hybrid code must be released under
the HESSLA (to avoid weakening the end-user protections and affirmative rights
afforded by the HESSLA). Hacktivismo is more than happy to consult with any
software developer about the license terms that should apply to any Software that
is derivative of any Program of which Hacktivismo is Author. If another Author
has released code under the HESSLA, then that Author has primary decision-making
authority about the manner in which his her or its software is licensed, but
Hacktivismo is happy to field any questions hat may be posed by such an Author or
by any developer who is building on another Author's HESSLAed code.

License Revisions: This License Agreement is subject to revision, prior to the
release of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, Version
1.0. We invite interested parties from the international academic and legal
communities to offer comments and suggestions on ways to improve this License
Agreement, prior to the time that The HESSLA version 1.0 is released.

The terms of the latest and most up-to-date version of this License Agreement, up
to and including version 1.0, shall be deemed automatically to supersede the
terms of any lower-numbered version of this License Agreement with respect to any
Licensee who became a Licensee under the lower-numbered version of the HESSLA.

The terms of the latest and most up-to-date version of this License Agreement
will always be published on the Hacktivismo Website, http://www.hacktivismo.com/.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, use and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND/OR MODIFICATION

0. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined terms that, whenever used in this
License Agreement, have the following meanings:

0.1 Author: "Author" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original Work (the
"Program") released by the Author under this License Agreement.

0.2 Copy: "Copy" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a copy
according to copyright law, without limitation. A "copy" does not become anything
other than a "copy" merely because, for example, a governmental or institutional
employee duplicates the Program or a part of it for another employee of the same
institution or Governmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one
computer to another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made
on the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental Entity.

0.3 Derivative Work: A "Derivative Work" or "work based on the Program" shall
mean either the Program itself or any work containing the Program or a portion of
it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification."). In the unlikely event that, and to the extent that, this
contractual definition of "Derivative Work" is later determined by any tribunal
or dispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of
"derivative work" under the copyright law of any country, then the broadest and
most encompassing possible definition either the contractual definition of
"Derivative Work," or any broader and more encompassing statutory or legal
definition, shall control. Acceptance of this contractually-defined scope of the
term "Derivative Work" is a mandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the
benefits offered by this License Agreement.

0.3.1 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program
(or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License
Agreement.

0.4 License Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms "this
License" or "this License Agreement" shall mean The Hactivismo Enhanced-Source
Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent version made applicable
under the terms of Section 15.

0.5 Licensee: The term "Licensee" shall mean You or any other Licensee, whether
or not a Qualified Licensee.

0.6 Original Work: "Original Work" shall mean a Program or other work of
authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.

0.7 Program: The "Program," to which this License Agreement applies, is the
Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer software) released by the
Author under this License Agreement.

0.8 Qualified Licensee: A "Qualified Licensee" means a Licensee that remains in
full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You are
no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any time, You violate any terms of this
License Agreement. Neither the Program nor any Software based on the Program may
be copied, distributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for
Your own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee. A Licensee other than a
Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and conditions of this License
Agreement, and to all remedies for each cumulative violation as set forth herein.
Loss of the status of Qualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of
the License Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits that
Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to additional
remedies for all violations occurring after the first violation.

0.9 Software: "Software" or "the Software" shall mean the Program, any Derivative
Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and/or any modified version of
the Program or portion thereof, without limitation.

0.10 Source Code: The term "Source Code" shall mean the preferred form of a
Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to access and modify that Program or Original Work.

0.10.1 For an executable work, complete Source Code means all the Source Code for
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However,
as a special exception, the Source Code distributed need not include anything
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

0.10.2 "Object Code:" Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control
rules, "object code" of the Program, or any modified version of the Program, or
Derivative Work based on the Program, must not be exported except by way of
distribution that is ancillary to the distribution of the Source Code. The
"Source Code" shall be understood as the primary content transferred or exported
by You, and the "object code" shall be considered as merely an ancillary
component of any such export distribution.

0.11 Strong Cryptography: "Strong Cryptography" shall mean cryptography no less
secure than (for example, and without limitation) a 2048-bit minimum key size for
RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key size for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a
256-bit minimum key size for AES and similar symmetric ciphers.

0.12 Substandard Key-Selection Technique: The term "Substandard Key-Selection
Technique" shall mean a method or technique to cause encryption keys to be more
easily guessed or less secure, such as by (i) causing the selection of keys to be
less than random, or (ii) employing a selection process that selects among only a
subset of possible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys
that can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about the
cryptographic techniques employed by You. The following illustrations elaborate
on the foregoing definition:

0.12.1 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption
algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more prime numbers, or
involves one or more mathematical functions or concatenations performed on one or
more prime numbers, then each prime number should be selected from a very large
set of candidate prime numbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible
prime numbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for example,
may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security), and absolutely not
from any artificially small set of candidate primes that makes the guessing of a
key easier than would be the case if a secure key-generation technique were
employed. In all instances, the primes should be selected at random from among
the candidate set. If there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the
security associated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the
cryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements of Section
0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection technique no less secure
than the customary industry standard for secure use of the cryptosystem.

0.12.2 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption
algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random integer, or the
transformation of a random integer through one or more mathematical processes,
then the selection of the integer shall be at random from the largest possible
set of all possible integers consistent with the secure functioning of the
encryption algorithm. It shall not be selected from an artificially small set of
integers (e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could not
set 200 of the 256 bits as "0," and randomly generate only the remaining 56 bits
producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of using the full 256 bits).

0.12.3 In other words, Your key-generation technique must promote security to the
maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic method(s) and keylength You elect
to employ, rather than facilitating eavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The
example of GSM telephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set
at "0," thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of 65,536, is
particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce the security of a
cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a less-secure or suboptimal subset of
possible keys, is prohibited and will violate this License Agreement if any such
technique is employed in any Software.

0.13 You: Each Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that have
violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified Licensees, but who
nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of this License Agreement and to
all cumulative remedies for each successive violation), is referred to as "You."

0.13.1 Governmental Entity: "You" explicitly includes any and all "Governmental
Entities," without limitation. "Governmental Entity" or "Governmental Entities,"
when used in this License Agreement, shall mean national governments,
sub-national governments (for example, and without limitation, provincial, state,
regional, local and municipal governments, autonomous governing units, special
districts, and other such entities), governmental subunits (without limitation,
governmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations, and the
like), supra-national governmental entities such as the European Union, and
entities through which one or more governments perform governmental functions or
exercise governmental power in coordination, cooperation or unison.

0.13.2 Governmental Person: "You" also explicitly includes "Governmental
Persons." The terms "Governmental Person" or "Governmental Persons," when used in
this License Agreement, shall mean the officials, officers, employees,
representatives, contractors and agents of any Governmental Entity.

1. Application of License Agreement. This License Agreement applies to any
Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a notice placed by the
Author saying it may be distributed under the terms of this License Agreement.
The preferred manner of placing such a notice is to include the following
statement immediately after the copyright notice for such an Original Work:

  "Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement,
  Version 0.1"

2. Means of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By Anyone
Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the special case of
certain Governmental Entities) any copying, modification, distribution, or use by
You of the Program or any Software, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms
and conditions of this License Agreement.

2.1 As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person to use the
Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your
copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License
Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions.

2.2 You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have accepted this
License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its terms and conditions.

2.3 You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or transfer a copy
to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee that has accepted this
License Agreement and such person is subject to all terms and conditions of this
License Agreement.

2.4 It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers an exclusive
right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy the Software. However,
for purposes of contract law, any use of the Software shall be considered to
constitute acceptance of this License Agreement. Moreover, all copying is
prohibited unless the recipient of a copy has accepted the License Agreement.
Because each such recipient Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit
anyone to access, use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting
the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees is
effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a copy of, or
access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting the License Agreement
through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's obligation to require acceptance
as a precondition of copying or access.

3. "Qualified Licensee" Requirement: Neither the Program nor any Software or
Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied, distributed, displayed,
performed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a
"Qualified Licensee." To remain a Qualified Licensee, You must remain in full
compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

4. License Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:

4.1 You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any copy,
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
will automatically terminate Your rights under this License Agreement and subject
You to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation that may be
available to the Author. However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies
from You (and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License
Agreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees, will not have
their rights under their License Agreements suspended or restricted on account of
anything You do, so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

4.2 You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to the time
You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License Agreement, You may always
elect instead not to copy, use, modify, distribute, compile, or perform the
Program or any Software released under this License Agreement. However, nothing
else grants You permission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a
copy in object code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify, or
to distribute the Program or any Software based on the Program. These actions are
prohibited by law if You do not accept this License Agreement. Additionally, as
set forth in Section 2, any use, copying or modification of the Software
constitutes acceptance of this License Agreement by You.

4.3 Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or Derivative Work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a License Agreement
from the Author to copy, distribute, modify, perform or display the Software,
subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You may not impose
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
License Agreement. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Author.

5. Grant of Source Code License.

5.1 Source Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises and agrees
except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to provide a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at the request of any
Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the most current version of the
Program in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive
and convenient access by You for so long as Author continues to distribute the
Program, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice
immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Program. Every
copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not necessarily every other
Author) consists of the Source Code accompanied, in some instances, by an
ancillary distribution of compiled Object Code, but the continued availability of
the Source Code from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have
(for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current, copy of the
Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You from exporting copies
to others without violating this license, see Section 8).

5.2 Grant of License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified
Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright
license to do the following:

5.2.1 to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies;

5.2.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit or modify
the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative Works;

5.2.3 to distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work and/or of
Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License
Agreement, and that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this
License Agreement.

6. Grant of Copyright License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a
Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement,
Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-sublicensable license to do the following:

6.1 to reproduce the Program in copies;

6.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon Software that
itself is based on the Program;

6.3 to distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by distributing
compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must be ancillary to a
distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program and Derivative Works to others,
with the proviso that copies of the Program or Derivative Works that You
distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, that You shall fully
inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement;

6.4 to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly;

6.5 to display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and

6.6 to charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the Program
(You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee).

7. Grant of Patent License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a
Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement,
Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-sublicensable license Agreement, under patent claims owned or controlled by
the Author that are embodied in the Program as furnished by the Author ("Licensed
Claims") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program. Subject to the
proviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license under any patent claims embodied in any Derivative Work furnished by You,
Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-sublicensable license under the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer
for sale Derivative Works.

8. Exclusions From License Agreement Grants. Nothing in this License Agreement
shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade
secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell
embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed Claims defined in
Section 7. No right is granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are
included in the Program. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted
to prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms from this
License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative Work that Author
otherwise would have a right to License.

8.1 Implied Endorsements Prohibited. Neither the name of the Author (in the case
of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo, the name "Hacktivismo"),
nor the names of contributors who helped produce the Program may be used to
endorse or promote modifications of the Program, any Derivative Work, or any
Software other than the Program, without specific prior written permission of the
Author. Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any contributors who
helped write the Program may be used to endorse or promote any Program or
Software released under this License Agreement by any person other than
Hacktivismo.

9. Modifications and Derivative Works. Only Qualified Licensees may modify the
Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works. If You are a Qualified
Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or prepare or distribute
Derivative Works (including permission to prepare and/or distribute Derivative
Works, as provided in Sections 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to
each and all of the following mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6,
inclusive):

9.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
changed the files and the date of any change;

9.2 If the modified Software normally reads commands interactively when run, You
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that You provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under this License
Agreement, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License Agreement.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on the Program is not required to
print an announcement.);

9.3 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You,
that incorporates any portion of the Original Work, must not contain any code or
functionality that subverts the security of the Software or the end-user's
expectations of privacy, anonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust,
including (without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any
"backdoor," escrow mechanism, "spy-ware," or surveillance techniques or methods
into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;

9.4 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You,
that employs any cryptographic or other security, privacy, confidentiality,
authenticity, and/or trust methods or techniques, including without limitation
any Derivative Work that includes any changes or modifications to any
cryptographic techniques in the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.

9.5 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You,
if it contains any key-generation or selection technique, must not employ any
Substandard Key-Selection Technique.

9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit or
communicate any symmetric key, any "private key" if an asymmetric cryptosystem is
employed, or any part of such key, nor may it otherwise make any such key or part
of such key known, to any person other than the end-user who generated the key,
without the active consent and participation of that individual end-user. If a
private or symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be
stored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading (at a
minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other techniques to
disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is even stored is strongly
encouraged, but not absolutely required.

10. Use Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited.

10.1 Neither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the
Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1 through 10.1.5,
inclusive):

10.1.1 to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any person of human
rights, including, without limitation, rights of privacy, security, collective
action, expression, political freedom, due process of law, and individual
conscience;

10.1.2 to gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any person of
human rights;

10.1.3 any other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive any person
of human rights, including not only the above-listed rights, but also rights of
physical security, liberty from physical restraint or incarceration, freedom from
slavery, freedom from torture, freedom to take part in government, either
directly or through lawfully elected representatives, and/or freedom from
self-incrimination;

10.1.4 any surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals, whether done by
a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by any non-governmental person
or entity;

10.1.5 censorship or "filtering" of any published information or expression.

10.2 Additionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any Software or
Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by any Governmental Entity
or other institution that has any policy or practice (whether official or
unofficial) of violating the human rights of any persons.

10.3 You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including, without
limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person) to use the Program or
any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or
copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and
has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions, including (without
limitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2, inclusive.

11. All Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to Distribution of
Source Code. Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control law, any
distribution by You of the Program or any Software may be in the form of Source
Code only, or in the form or Source Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but
You may not export any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only. Such an
export distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be ancillary to
a distribution of the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed on a medium, or by a method, customarily used for software
interchange.

12. EXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE EXPORT LAWS
OF YOUR JURISDICTION. It is Your responsibility to comply with any export
regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction. From the United States, Canada, or
many countries in Europe, export or transmission of this Software to certain
embargoed destinations (including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited. If Hacktivismo is
identified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of some other
Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of these countries, by any Licensee
who has received this Software directly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the
Dead Cow, or any of their members, is contractually prohibited and will
constitute a violation of this License Agreement. You are advised to consult the
current laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You, before
exporting this Software to any destination. Special care should be taken to avoid
export to any embargoed destination. An Author other than Hacktivismo may
substitute that Author's legal name for "Hacktivismo" in this Paragraph, in
relation to any Program released by that Author under this Paragraph.

13. Contrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a consequence of a
court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License Agreement,
they do not excuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under this
License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You
may not distribute the Software at all. For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy
both it and this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from distribution
of the Program.

It is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
Section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the software
distribution system reflected in this License Agreement, which is implemented by
public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
wide range of software distributed through related distribution systems, in
reliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is up to the
Author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any
other system and a Licensee cannot impose that choice.

14. Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity ("Governmental Entity" is
defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or Governmental Person (as
"Governmental Person" is defined broadly in Section 0.13.2), that uses, modifies,
changes, copies, displays, performs, or distributes the Program, or any Software
or Derivative Work based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the
following terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are agreed to and
fully met:

14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of any
"Governmental Person," if it is the position of that Governmental Person's
Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or doctrines of law (including, without
limitation, any doctrine(s) of immunity or any formalities of contract formation)
may render this License Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable
against such Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such Governmental
Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy
or distribution of the Program, or of any Software or Derivative Work based on
the Program, or any part thereof, by the Governmental Entity, or by any
Governmental Person of that Governmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be
required to inform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed
to render this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully enforceable
against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental Person of such entity, and
to explain in reasonable detail what additional steps, if taken, would render the
License Agreement fully enforceable against such entity or person. Failure to
provide the required written notice to the Author in advance of any such use,
modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution, shall
constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all reliance on any
doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not included or that is omitted
from the required written notice (failure to provide any written notice means all
reliance on any doctrine is irrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that
provides written notice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the
Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use, change,
display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of the Software or any
part thereof, until such time as a License Agreement is in place, agreed upon by
the Author and by the Governmental Entity, that such entity concedes is
fully-enforceable. Any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy, or
distribution following written notice under this Paragraph, but without the
implementation of an agreement as provided herein, shall constitute an
irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the Governmental Entity (and any and all
Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any
legal doctrine either referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.

14.2 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, or
distributes, the Software or any part or portion thereof, or any Governmental
Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the
person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), permanently and
irrevocably waives any defense based on sovereign immunity, official immunity,
the Act of State Doctrine, or any other form of immunity, that might otherwise
apply as a defense to, or a bar against, any legal action based on the terms of
this License Agreement.

14.2.1 With respect to any enforcement action brought by the Author in a United
States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any
Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby
expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . .
. in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).
Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the
"commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), (3) are
also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or
any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S.
Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a
corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other
sovereign.

14.2.2 With respect to any enforcement action brought by an authorized end-user
(as a third-party beneficiary, under the terms of Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10)
in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any
Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby
expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . .
. in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).
. Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the
"commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), (3) are
also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or
any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S.
Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a
corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other
sovereign.

14.2.3 With respect to any action or effort by the Author in the United States to
execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or
executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by
any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby
expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case in
which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of
execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(1) of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental
Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity"
exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With
respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States
Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity
shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of
immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.4 With respect to any action or effort brought by an authorized end-user (as
a third-party beneficiary, in accordance with Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in
the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by
attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity,
the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2
is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a
case in which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid
of execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(1) of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental
Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity"
exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With
respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States
Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity
shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of
immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.3 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays,
performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any Governmental
Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the
person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), and thereby violates
any terms and conditions of Section 9 (restrictions on modification), or
Paragraph 10 (use restrictions), agrees that the person or entity is subject not
only to an action by the Author, for the enforcement of this License Agreement
and for money damages and injunctive relief (as well as attorneys' fees,
additional and statutory damages, and other remedies as provided by law), but
such Governmental Entity and/or Person also shall be subject to a suit for money
damages and injunctive relief by any person whose human rights have been violated
or infringed, in violation of this License Agreement, or through the use of any
Software in violation of this License Agreement. Any person who brings an action
under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity must notify the
Author promptly of the action and provide the Author the opportunity to intervene
to assert the Author's own rights. Damages in such a third-party action shall be
measured by the severity of the human rights violation and the copyright
infringement or License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by
reference to the copyright infringement. All end-users, to the extent that they
are entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of this
License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this License
Agreement. Punitive damages may be awarded in such a third-party action against a
Governmental Entity or Governmental Person, and each and every such Governmental
Entity or Person conclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive
damages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages to the extend such
limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of such person or entity's
status as a Governmental Person or Governmental Entity.

14.4 Any State of the United States, or any subunit or Governmental Entity
thereof, that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes
the Software of any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so
(whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or
was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for
purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to
remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the
third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 -- any immunity under
the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution or any other immunity
doctrine (such as sovereign immunity or qualified, or other, official immunity)
that may apply to state governments, subunits, or to their Governmental Persons.

14.5 Any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State of the
United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs, displays, or
distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental
Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's
action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably
waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement,
(ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of
the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any doctrine (such
as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme Court decision
of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies solely to prospective
injunctive relief. Also explicitly and irrevocably waived is any underlying
immunity doctrine that would require the recognition of such a limited exception
for purposes of remedies. The remedies against such governmental entities and
persons shall explicitly include money damages, additional damages, statutory
damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, costs and
fees that might otherwise be barred or limited in amount on account of
governmental status.

14.6 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays,
performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose
Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends
the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and
irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License
Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to
invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any
and all reliance on the Act of State doctrine, sovereign immunity, international
comity, or any other doctrine of immunity whether such doctrine is recognized in
that government's own courts, or in the courts of any other government or nation.

14.6.1 Consistent with Subparagraphs 14.2.1 through 14.2.4, this waiver shall
explicitly be understood to constitute a waiver not only against suit, but also
against execution against property, for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). All United States Governmental Entities
shall be understood to have agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity against
(i) suit in the courts of other sovereigns, and (ii) execution against property
of the United States located within the territory of other countries.

14.7 Governmental Persons, (i) who violate this License Agreement (whether that
person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not,
authorized or official), or (ii) who are personally involved in any activity,
policy or practice of a governmental entity that violates this License Agreement
(whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or
was not, authorized or official), or (iii) that use, copy, change, modify,
perform, display or distribute, the Software or any part thereof, when their
Governmental Entity is not permitted to do so, or is not a Qualified Licensee, or
has violated the terms of this License Agreement, each and all individually waive
and shall not be permitted to assert any defense of official immunity, "good
faith" immunity, qualified immunity, absolute immunity, or other immunity based
on his or her governmental status.

14.8 No Governmental Entity, nor any Governmental Person thereof may, by
legislative, regulatory, or other action, exempt such Governmental Entity,
subunit, or person, from the terms of this License Agreement, if the Governmental
Entity or any such person has voluntarily used, modified, copied, displayed,
performed, or distributed the Software or any part thereof.

14.9 Enforcement In Courts of Other Sovereigns Permitted. By using, modifying,
changing, displaying, performing or distributing any Software covered by this
License Agreement, any Governmental Entity hereby voluntarily and irrevocably
consents, for purposes of (i) any action to enforce the terms of this License
Agreement, and (ii) any action to enforce the Author's copyright (whether such
suit be for injunctive relief, damages, or both) to the jurisdiction of any court
or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a
subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the terms of this License
Agreement are believed by the Author to be enforceable. Each such Governmental
Entity hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections
based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non
conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or
immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.

14.9.1 The Waiver by any Governmental Entity of a country other than the United
States shall be understood explicitly to constitute a waiver for purposes of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (see Subparagraphs 14.2.1to 14.2.4,
inclusive, supra), and all United States Governmental Entities shall be
understood to have agreed to a waive correspondingly broad in scope with respect
to actions brought in the courts of other sovereigns.

14.9.2 Forum Selection Non-U.S. Governmental Entities. Governmental Entities that
are not United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree
to be subject to suit, in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring an action in another
court in another country, but the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia, shall always be available as an agreed-upon forum for such an
action. At the optional election of any Author (or, in the case of a third-party
claim, any end-user asserting rights under Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10), such a
suit against a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or Person may be brought in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, as a direct
substitute for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for
all purposes of this Subparagraph.

14.9.3 Forum Selection U.S. Governmental Entities. All United States Governmental
Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the
following (non-exclusive) list of fora: Ottawa, Canada, London, England, and
Paris, France. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring action in another
court that can exercise jurisdiction. But the courts in these three locations
shall always be available (at the option of the Author or an authorized end-user)
as a forum for resolving any dispute with the United States or a governmental
subunit thereof. Except as provided in Subparagraph 14.10, any and all United
States Governmental Persons shall be subject to suit wherever applicable rules of
personal jurisdiction and venue shall permit such suit to be filed, but no such
United States Governmental Person may assert any defense based on forum non
conveniens or international comity, to the selection of any particular lawful
venue.

14.10 Enforcement Of Claims For Human Rights Violations. By using, copying,
modifying, changing, performing, displaying or distributing the Software covered
by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity, or Governmental Person hereby
voluntarily and irrevocably consents -- for purposes of any third-party action to
remedy human rights violations and other violations of this License Agreement (as
reflected in Section 14.3) -- to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any
other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or
state of such country) in which the third-party beneficiary reasonably believes
the relevant terms of this License Agreement are enforceable. The Governmental
Entity or Person hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all
objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of
forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental
status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other
sovereign.

14.10.1 Waiver of Immunity and Forum Selection. The presumptively valid and
preferred fora identified in Subparagraphs 14.9.2 and 14.9.3 shall also apply for
purposes of Subparagraph 14.10. All Governmental Entities are subject to the same
Waiver of Immunity as set forth in Subparagraphs 14.2.1 to 14.2.4, inclusive.

15. Subsequent Versions of HESSLA. Hacktivismo may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Any Program released by
Hacktivismo under a version of this License Agreement prior to Version 1.0, shall
be considered released under Version 1.0 of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source
Software License Agreement, once Version 1.0 is formally released. Prior to
Version 1.0, any Software released by Hacktivismo or a Licensee of Hacktivismo
under a lower-numbered version of the HESSLA shall be considered automatically to
be subject to a higher-number version of the HESSLA, whenever a later-numbered
version has been released.

Concerning the work of any other Author, if the Program specifies a version
number of this License Agreement which applies to it and "any later version," You
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by Hacktivismo. If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License Agreement, You may choose any version after 1.0,
once version 1.0 is published by Hacktivismo, and prior to publication of version
1.0, You may choose any version of the Hacktivismo Software License Agreement
then published by Hacktivismo. If the Program released by another Author,
specifies only a version number, then that version number only shall apply. If
"the latest version," is specified, then the latest version of the HESSLA
published on the Hacktivismo Website shall always apply at all times.

16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL
WORK IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
WITH ALL FAULTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS GRANTED HEREUNDER
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING THE AUTHOR'S NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR
THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION, BUT SHALL EXCLUDE SUCH
LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

18. ENCRYPTION KEYS AND PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE. SOFTWARE RELEASED UNDER THIS
LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY REQUIRE A DIGITAL CERTIFICATE, OR AN ENCRYPTION KEY
"SIGNED" BY A TRUSTED PARTY, TO FUNCTION. AUTHOR UNDERTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE PROPER, SECURE, AND ADEQUATE FUNCTIONING OF ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS, OF ANY
CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, OR FOR THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF ANY END-USER, ANY ISSUER OF
CERTIFICATES, OR OF ANY SIGNER OF ENCRYPTION KEYS. USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS AT THE
END-USER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. IN ANY PUBLIC-KEY INFRASTRUCTURE ("PKI")
SYSTEM, AN END-USER'S LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE END-USER'S CERTIFICATION
AUTHORITY DOES NOT INCLUDE OR ENCOMPASS ANY LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AUTHOR,
AND IS GOVERNED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY THE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY'S
CERTIFICATION PRACTICE STATEMENT AND CERTIFICATION AGREEMENTS. AUTHOR ASSUMES NO
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY END-USER OR ANY CERTIFICATION
AUTHORITY.

18. Saving Clause. If any portion of this License Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the License
Agreement is intended to apply and the License Agreement as a whole is intended
to apply in other circumstances.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

---

IBM Public License v1.0
(@zowe/perf-timing 1.0.7)

IBM Public License Version 1.0
==============================

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM PUBLIC LICENSE
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.


1. DEFINITIONS
--------------

"Contribution" means:

  1. in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the
    Original Program, and

  2. in the case of each Contributor,

      1. changes to the Program, and

      2. additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
    distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from
    a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
    anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
    additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
    distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license
    agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this
Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and
documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
all Contributors.


2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
------------------

  1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
    such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

  2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
    Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
    covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.

  3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
    its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
    any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
    infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
    assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
    needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
    allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

  4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
    set forth in this Agreement.


3. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

  1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement

; and

  * its license agreement:

      1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
        conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
        title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
        merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

      2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
        damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;

      3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
        by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

      4. states that source code for the Program is available from such
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

    When the Program is made available in source code form:

      1. it must be made available under this Agreement

    ; and

  * a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the
Program:

      Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and
      others. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to
identify the originator of the Contribution.


4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.


5. NO WARRANTY
--------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.


6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
--------------------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


7. GENERAL
----------

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a
patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version
number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a
new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute
the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other
than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly
granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after
the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

Python Software Foundation License 2.0
(nodeca-argparse 2.0.1)

This license was approved as the official PSF License Version 2 on October 22,
2004. The only differences between this and version 1 of the PSF license consist
of removing Python version numbers (like 2.1.1 or 2.3).



PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2
============================================

--------------------------------------------

  1.  This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"),
    and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using
    this software ("Python") in source or binary form and its associated
    documentation.

  2.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
    grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to
    reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative
    works, distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative
    version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
    copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 Python Software
    Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are retained in Python alone or in any
    derivative version prepared by Licensee.

  3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
    incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative
    work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees to
    include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.

  4.  PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis. PSF MAKES
    NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT
    NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF
    PYTHON WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

  5.  PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON FOR ANY
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
    MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
    THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

  6.  This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach
    of its terms and conditions.

  7.  Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
    relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and
    Licensee. This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF
    trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products
    or services of Licensee, or any third party.

  8.  By copying, installing or otherwise using Python, Licensee agrees to be
    bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
