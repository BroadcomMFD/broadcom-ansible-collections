Synopsis
--------

The SUBMIT top line command modifies and expedites the process of job submission for jobs already residing in the queues.







Parameters
----------

  ca7num (*required*, type: str)
    Ca7num=0016

    

    Defines the name of the job to Submit.

    Indicates the individual job to Submit, and the value must be a CA 7 job number.



  express (type: str)
    Example: YES

    

    (Optional) Indicates to place the job ahead of all other jobs (those jobs without EXPRESS=YES) for submission.

    

    The value must be coded as shown. Not valid if workload balancing is being used.

    

    Use of EXPRESS=YES does not establish an increased execution priority for a job.

    

    Rather, it ensures that nonexpress jobs are not submitted ahead of a job that is flagged as an express job.



  host (*required*, type: str)
    Host name of the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  port (*required*, type: int)
    Port for the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  user (*required*, type: str)
    User name for authenticating connections to the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  password (*required*, type: str)
    Password for authenticating connections to the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  base_path (type: str)
    The base path for your Zowe API Mediation Layer instance. Specify this option to prepend the base path to all resources when making REST requests. Do not specify this option if you are not using an Zowe API Mediation Layer.



  protocol (*required*, type: str)
    Specifies protocol to use for CA7 connection (http or https).


    Choices:
      * ``http`` 
      * ``https`` 

  reject_unauthorized (type: bool, default: ``True``)
    Reject self-signed certificates.



  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.
