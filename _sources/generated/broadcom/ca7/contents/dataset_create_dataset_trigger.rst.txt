Synopsis
--------

Create Dataset Trigger.







Parameters
----------

  dataset_name (type: str)
    (Required if dataset-number is omitted) Specifies the data set name whose creation/update causes triggering of a job.

    Note: For VSAM files, specify the cluster name.

    Limits: 1 to 44 alphanumeric characters.



  dataset_number (type: str)
    (Required if dataset-name is omitted) Specifies the existing data set number whose creation causes triggering. The number is the value that CA 7 assigned to the data set.

    Limits: 1 to 8 numeric characters.



  schid (type: str)
    (Optional) Specifies for which schedule ID of the triggering dataset the triggered-job is scheduled.

    Note: If the data set is one that is tracked with use of SASSXDSN (externally tracked data sets), the schid field must be 000 for the trigger to work

    Default: 0 (all schedule IDs)

    Limits: 1 to 3 numeric characters from 0 through 999.



  triggered_job (*required*, type: str)
    Specifies the job name that the completion of the triggering dataset triggers.

    Limits: 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters.



  triggered_job_schid (type: str)
    (Optional) Denotes a replacement schedule ID to use when the triggered-job is placed into the request queue.

    Default: 0 (no replacement)

    Limits: 1 to 3 numeric characters from 0 through 999

    Note: If triggered-job-schid is used, it replaces the schid value of the triggered job. Any jobs triggered (by triggered-job or data sets it creates) use this triggered-job-schid for their schedule ID unless they also have a triggered-job-schid value.



  triggered_job_due_out_time (type: str)
    (Required if triggered-job-queue-time is omitted) Specifies the due-out time of day of the triggered-job rounded down to 10-minute increments.

    If this parameter is used, triggered-job-queue-time must be omitted.

    Limits: 4 numeric characters that are specified as hhmm, where hh can be 00 through 24 and mm can be 00 through 59, the highest value being 2400. If specified, the lowest value is 10.

    Note: If used and the due-out-time of the triggering job is after the triggered-job-due-out-time, the following calendar day is assumed.



  triggered_job_queue_time (type: str)
    (Required if triggered-job-due-out-time is omitted) Specifies the elapsed queue time of triggered-job rounded down to 10-minute increments.

    If this parameter is used, triggered-job-due-out-time must be omitted because due-out time is then calculated as deadline time plus runtime.

    Deadline time is calculated as current date/time plus queue time.

    Limits: 4 numeric characters that are specified as hhmm, where hh can be 00 through 24.

    The mm can be 00 through 59, the highest value being 2400.



  triggered_job_lead_time (type: str)
    (Optional) Specifies the elapsed lead time for triggered-job rounded to 10-minute increments. This parameter specifies the lead or processing time necessary to ensure triggered-job meets its due-out time.

    Default: 0000

    Limits: 4 numeric characters that are specified as hhmm, where hh can be 00 through 24.

    The mm can be 00 through 59, the highest value being 2400.



  triggered_job_submit_time (type: str)
    (Optional) Imposes a submit time of day requirement on triggered-job. When used, the job is not submitted before this time.

    The triggered-job-submit-time is always rounded down to 15-minute increments.

    Default: 0 (no specific submit time requirement)

    Limits: 4 numeric characters that are specified as hhmm, where hh can be 00 through 24 and mm can be 00 through 59, the highest value being 2400.

    Note: If triggered-job-queue-time is used, the date for the submit time requirement is the same as the deadline start date.

    

    If triggered-job-due-out-time is used and the triggered-job-submit-time is less than the triggered-job-due-out-time, the date for the triggered-job-submit-time is the same as the deadline start date. Otherwise, the triggered-job-submit-time date is the previous day.



  host (*required*, type: str)
    Host name of the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  port (*required*, type: int)
    Port for the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  user (*required*, type: str)
    User name for authenticating connections to the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  password (*required*, type: str)
    Password for authenticating connections to the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  base_path (type: str)
    The base path for your Zowe API Mediation Layer instance. Specify this option to prepend the base path to all resources when making REST requests. Do not specify this option if you are not using an Zowe API Mediation Layer.



  protocol (*required*, type: str)
    Specifies protocol to use for CA7 connection (http or https).


    Choices:
      * ``http`` 
      * ``https`` 

  reject_unauthorized (type: bool, default: ``True``)
    Reject self-signed certificates.



  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.










Examples

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: Create a Dataset Trigger definition DATA.SET.NAME with schid 42 for Triggered job JOBA
      broadcom.ca7.dataset_create_dataset_trigger:
        dataset_name: DATA.SET.NAME

        triggered_job_due_out_time: 0830




Return Values
-------------

data (type: list, *when returned data is a dictionary*)
  Data from the module execution (a data structure). The items of this dict are set as individual return values on the top level as well.


error (type: complex, *error*)

  resource (type: str, *API request failed*)
    URI of the resource of the API service request.



failed (type: bool, *always*)
  A boolean that indicates if the task was failed or not.


list (type: list, *when returned data is a list*)
  Data from the module execution (a list of data structures).


msg (type: str, *sometimes*)
