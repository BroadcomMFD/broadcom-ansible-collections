Synopsis
--------

Delete Dataset Trigger.







Parameters
----------

  dataset_name (type: str)
    (Required if dataset-number is omitted) Specifies the data set name whose creation/update causes triggering of a job.

    Note: For VSAM files, specify the cluster name.

    Limits: 1 to 44 alphanumeric characters.



  dataset_number (type: str)
    (Required if dataset-name is omitted) Specifies the existing data set number whose creation causes triggering. The number is the value that CA 7 assigned to the data set.

    Limits: 1 to 8 numeric characters.



  schid (type: str)
    (Optional) Specifies for which schedule ID of the triggering dataset the triggered-job is scheduled.

    Note: If the data set is one that is tracked with use of SASSXDSN (externally tracked data sets), the schid field must be 000 for the trigger to work

    Default: 0 (all schedule IDs)

    Limits: 1 to 3 numeric characters from 0 through 999.



  triggered_job (*required*, type: str)
    Specifies the job name that the completion of the triggering dataset triggers.

    Limits: 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters.



  host (*required*, type: str)
    Host name of the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  port (*required*, type: int)
    Port for the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  user (*required*, type: str)
    User name for authenticating connections to the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  password (*required*, type: str)
    Password for authenticating connections to the CA7 API service that is running on the mainframe system.



  base_path (type: str)
    The base path for your Zowe API Mediation Layer instance. Specify this option to prepend the base path to all resources when making REST requests. Do not specify this option if you are not using an Zowe API Mediation Layer.



  protocol (*required*, type: str)

  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.
