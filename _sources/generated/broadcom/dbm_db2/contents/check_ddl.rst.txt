check_ddl -- Validate the syntax of input DDL and optionally verify Db2 object dependencies
===========================================================================================

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Validate the syntax of input DDL and optionally verify Db2 object dependencies. Use this command to ensure that the syntax of the input DDL is valid. You can also optionally verify that the objects to be created do not exist on the Db2 subsystem and that the related objects that are required for successful creation of the objects exist on the Db2 subsystem or in the input DDL. You can generate input DDL using the 'zowe dbm generate ddl' command.

 

For details about command usage for automation, see DBM-Db2 samples at https://github.com/BroadcomMFD/dbm-db2-for-zowe-cli.







Parameters
----------

  local_input_ddl_filename (*required*, type: str)
    Specifies the local input file that contains the DDL statements for the Db2 objects that you want to validate on a target subsystem. Typically, this file is created by a 'zowe dbm generate ddl' command or retrieved from an archive. You can edit this file.



  target_db2 (*required*, type: str)
    Specifies the target Db2 subsystem or data sharing group where you want to validate the DDL.

         

    Note: If you specify the data sharing group, the first active Db2 subsystem in the group is used. 



  verify (type: str)
    Specifies whether to verify that the objects to be created do not exist on the Db2 subsystem and that the related objects that are required for successful creation of the objects exist on the Db2 subsystem or in the input DDL.

    

    Default value: no 


    Choices:
      * ``yes`` 
      * ``no`` 

  modification (type: str)
    Identifies a named set of server-managed default parameter values that control the execution behavior of the zowe dbm-db2 commands. For example, you can use a modification to identify a set of default values that differ from the set of values that are normally used.

      

    For more information about using the modification option, see the DBM Data Service documentation at https://techdocs.broadcom.com/db2mgmt .



  error_file (type: str)
    Specifies the local output error file in YAML format that contains basic execution information, connection details, dbm-db2 profile parameters, used arguments, and errors that occurred during execution of the command.

          

    Default value: error.log 



  job_cards (type: list)
    Specifies a string array of z/OS JCL JOB statements.



  work_dataset_prefix (type: str)
    Specifies the prefix that is used as the high level qualifier in z/OS work data set names.



  authid (type: str)
    Specifies the primary Db2 authorization ID (user ID) that is used to establish a connection between Db2 and a process.



  sqlid (type: str)
    Specifies the authorization ID that is used as the value in generated SET CURRENT SQLID statements most of the time.



  overwrite_output_files (type: bool)
    Specifies whether to overwrite output files when they already exist.



  protocol (type: str)
    Specifies the communication protocol to use between the zowe dbm-db2 client and the DBM Data Service.


    Choices:
      * ``http`` 
      * ``https`` 

  environment_list (type: str)
    Specifies an object of one or more values consisting of a Db2 subsystem ID and a DBM Data Service environment pair. The paired entry identifies the DBM Data Service environment to use for a subsystem that is accessible through multiple DBM Data Service environments. For more information about configuring the DBM Data Service, see the Database Management Solutions for Db2 for z/OS documentation at https://techdocs.broadcom.com/db2mgmt.



  host (type: str)
    Host name of service on the mainframe.



  port (type: int)
    Port number of service on the mainframe.



  user (type: str)
    User name to authenticate to service on the mainframe.



  password (type: str)
    Password to authenticate to service on the mainframe.



  reject_unauthorized (type: bool, default: ``True``)
    Reject self-signed certificates.



  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.

Return Values
-------------

data (type: list, *when returned data is a dictionary*)
  Data from the module execution (a data structure). The items of this dict are set as individual return values on the top level as well.


error (type: complex, *error*)
  More details about why the action has failed. If the failure is when calling an API service, the response contains the connection parameters.


  additional_details (type: str)
    Detailed message about the failure.


  msg (type: str)
    Short description of the result or failure.


  request (type: str, *API request failed*)
    HTTP method used to invoke API service request.


  resource (type: str, *API request failed*)
    URI of the resource of the API service request.



failed (type: bool, *always*)
  A boolean that indicates if the task was failed or not.


list (type: list, *when returned data is a list*)
  Data from the module execution (a list of data structures).


msg (type: str, *sometimes*)
  Short description of the result or failure.


rc (type: int, *always*)
  Exit code of the module, successful exit code is 0, failure is typically 1 or higher.


stderr (type: str, *error*)
  Details of the error.


stdout (type: str, *success*)
  Summary of the result.
