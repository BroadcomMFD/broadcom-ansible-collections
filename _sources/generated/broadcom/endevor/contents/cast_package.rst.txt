Synopsis
--------

The cast package module prepares the Package for review and subsequent execution. Casting a Package freezes the contents of the Package and prevents further changes to the Package.







Parameters
----------

  package (type: str)
    Name of the Endevor package.



  from_date_time (type: str)
    Specify the beginning of time frame within which the package can be executed. Use yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm or see ISO 8601 standard for syntax.



  to_date_time (type: str)
    Specify the end of time frame within which the package can be executed. Use yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm or see ISO 8601 standard for syntax.



  validate_components (type: str)
    Specify "yes" to enable component validation within the package, "no" to disable, and "warn" to generate a warning if component validation fails.
