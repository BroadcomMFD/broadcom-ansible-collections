Parameters
----------

  task_id (type: str)
    The id of an asynchronous Endevor web service task.



  task_status (type: str, default: ``all``)
    Filter tasks by status: in-progress, finished or all.


    Choices:
      * ``inp`` 
      * ``fin`` 
      * ``all`` **←**

  host (type: str)
    Specifies the base host name.



  port (type: str)
    Specifies the port number.



  instance (type: str)
    Specifies Endevor Web Services dataSource name.



  protocol (type: str, default: ``https``)
    Specifies the protocol used for connecting to Endevor Rest API.


    Choices:
      * ``http`` 
      * ``https`` **←**

  user (type: str)
    Specifies the user name.



  password (type: str)
    Specifies the user's password.



  reject_unauthorized (type: bool)
    Specify this option to have the server certificate verified against the list of supplied CAs.



  base_path (type: str)
    Specifies the base path used for connecting to Endevor Rest API.



  suppress_messages (type: bool)
    Suppress all [INFO]/[WARN] messages from terminal output.



  report_file (type: str)
    File name for saving reports from Endevor SCM locally.



  report_dir (type: str)
    Directory for saving reports from Endevor SCM locally, if wasn't specified. Defaults to current directory.



  write_report (type: bool)
    Write the endevor reports to a file. By default, when return code is 0, no report will be written, unless this option is specified. When return code is bigger than 0, reports will be written to a file, unless this option is specifed to be false.



  full_output (type: bool)
    Specify this option if you want a full output of list action.



  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.



  response_format_filter (type: list)
    Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a module to a single field/property or a list of a single field/property.



  response_format_type (type: str)
    The module response output format type. Must be one of the following:

    

    table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a column in the table.

    

    list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry in an array.

    

    object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object). Can be used in place of "table" to change from tabular output to a list of prettified objects.

    

    string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.


    Choices:
      * ``table`` 
      * ``list`` 
      * ``object`` 
      * ``string`` 

  response_format_header (type: bool)
    If "--response-format-type table" is specified, include the column headers in the output.

Return Values
-------------

data (type: list, *when returned data is a dictionary*)
