Synopsis
--------

Query components used by a specified Element with the Endevor ACM Query facility.







Parameters
----------

  element (*required*, type: str)
    Name of the Endevor element.



  environment (type: str)
    The Endevor environment where your project resides.



  system (type: str)
    The Endevor system where your project resides.



  subsystem (type: str)
    The Endevor subsystem where your project resides.



  type (type: str)
    Name of the Endevor element's type.



  stage_number (type: str)
    The Endevor stage number where your project resides.


    Choices:
      * ``\*`` 
      * ``\%`` 
      * ``1`` 
      * ``2`` 

  maxrc (type: int, default: ``8``)
    The maximum value of the return code of a successful action. When the return code is greater than the maxrc value, the module fails.



  exc_circulars (type: bool)
    Filters the result to exclude components that have a circular relationship to the subject of your search.



  exc_indirect (type: bool)
    Filters the result to exclude indirectly related components.



  exc_related (type: bool)
    Filters the result to exclude related components.



  full_output (type: bool)
    Specify this option if you want a full output of list action.



  asynchronous (type: bool)
    Submit this module as an asynchronous Endevor Web Services task.



  host (type: str)
    Specifies the base host name.



  port (type: str)
    Specifies the port number.



  instance (type: str)
    Specifies Endevor Web Services dataSource name.



  protocol (type: str, default: ``https``)
    Specifies the protocol used for connecting to Endevor Rest API.


    Choices:
      * ``http`` 
      * ``https`` **‚Üê**

  user (type: str)
    Specifies the user name.



  password (type: str)
    Specifies the user's password.



  reject_unauthorized (type: bool)
    Specify this option to have the server certificate verified against the list of supplied CAs.



  base_path (type: str)
    Specifies the base path used for connecting to Endevor Rest API.



  suppress_messages (type: bool)
    Suppress all [INFO]/[WARN] messages from terminal output.



  report_file (type: str)
    File name for saving reports from Endevor SCM locally.



  report_dir (type: str)
    Directory for saving reports from Endevor SCM locally, if wasn't specified. Defaults to current directory.



  write_report (type: bool)
    Write the endevor reports to a file. By default, when return code is 0, no report will be written, unless this option is specified. When return code is bigger than 0, reports will be written to a file, unless this option is specifed to be false.



  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.



  response_format_filter (type: list)
    Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a module to a single field/property or a list of a single field/property.



  response_format_type (type: str)
    The module response output format type. Must be one of the following:

    

    table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a column in the table.

    

    list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry in an array.

    

    object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object). Can be used in place of "table" to change from tabular output to a list of prettified objects.

    

    string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.


    Choices:
      * ``table`` 
      * ``list`` 
      * ``object`` 
      * ``string`` 

  response_format_header (type: bool)
    If "--response-format-type table" is specified, include the column headers in the output.










Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: query all the components used by element "elementName" from the specified inventory location with the endevor profile set up
      broadcom.endevor.queryacm_components:
        element: elementName
        environment: ENVNAME
        system: SYSNAME
        subsystem: SUBNAME
        type: TYPENAME
        stage_number: 1
        instance: ENDEVOR




Return Values
-------------

data (type: list, *when returned data is a dictionary*)
  Data from the module execution (a data structure). The items of this dict are set as individual return values on the top level as well.


error (type: complex, *error*)
