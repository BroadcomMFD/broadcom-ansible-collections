    Specify if you want to preserve the change history of the Elements while performing the synchronization during element update.



  sync_fingerprint (type: str)
    Specifies the fingerprint of the element directly up the map that the updated element should be synchronized with. Prevents the sync if the element up the map doesn't match the fingerprint.
