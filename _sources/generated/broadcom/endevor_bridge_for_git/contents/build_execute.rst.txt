Synopsis
--------

Build changes against remote git repository's Endevor Bridge for Git synchronized branch, using work area or build subsystem.It does not support autogen for building dependencies.







Parameters
----------

  endevor_instance (type: str)
    The Endevor Web Services Endevor configuration name.



  work_area_id (type: str)
    Endevor work area ID. Name-masking is not allowed.



  endevor_subsystem (type: str)
    The Endevor SCM build subsystem. Note: The build subsystem can be cleared without prior permission.



  endevor_environment (type: str)
    The Endevor SCM environment where your build subsystem resides.



  endevor_system (type: str)
    The Endevor SCM system where your build subsystem resides.



  work_dir (type: str, default: ``./``)
    The local working directory of your Git-Endevor mapping that you are building.



  listing_dir (type: str, default: ``.endevor/listings``)
    Specify the directory where you would like to have your build outputs downloaded.



  listing_rc (type: int, default: ``4``)
    All the elements that have a generate result equal to or greater than "listing-rc" will have their build outputs downloaded into "listing-dir".



  force_cleanup (type: bool)
    Starts the build process after cleaning the build subsystem.



  endevor_protocol (type: str)
    The Endevor SCM Rest API protocol. 

    

    Default value: http


    Choices:
      * ``http`` 
      * ``https`` 

  endevor_host (type: str)
    The Endevor Rest API hostname.



  endevor_port (type: int)
    The Endevor Rest API port.



  endevor_user (type: str)
    Mainframe (Endevor) username, which can be the same as your TSO login.



  endevor_password (type: str)
    Mainframe (Endevor) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.



  endevor_reject_unauthorized (type: bool)
    Reject self-signed certificates. 

    

    Default value: true



  endevor_base_path (type: str)
    The Endevor SCM Rest API base path. 

    

    Default value: EndevorService/rest



  host (type: str)
    Host name of service on the mainframe.



  port (type: int)
    Port number of service on the mainframe.



  user (type: str)
    User name to authenticate to service on the mainframe.



  password (type: str)
    Password to authenticate to service on the mainframe.



  reject_unauthorized (type: bool, default: ``True``)
    Reject self-signed certificates.



  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.



  response_format_filter (type: list)
    Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single field/property or a list of a single field/property.



  response_format_type (type: str)
    The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

    

    table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a column in the table.

    

    list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry in an array.

    

    object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object). Can be used in place of "table" to change from tabular output to a list of prettified objects.

    

    string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.


    Choices:
      * ``table`` 
      * ``list`` 
      * ``object`` 
      * ``string`` 

  response_format_header (type: bool)
    If "--response-format-type table" is specified, include the column headers in the output.
