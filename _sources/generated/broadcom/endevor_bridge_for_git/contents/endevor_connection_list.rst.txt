Synopsis

List Endevor connections used by Endevor Bridge for Git.







Parameters
----------

  protocol (*required*, type: str, default: ``https``)
    The Endevor Bridge for Git SCM protocol. 

    

    Default value: https


    Choices:
      * ``http`` 
      * ``https`` **‚Üê**

  host (*required*, type: str)
    The Endevor Bridge for Git hostname.



  port (*required*, type: int)
    The Endevor Bridge for Git port.



  user (*required*, type: str)
    Endevor Bridge for Git username (your git username).



  token (*required*, type: str)
    Git personal access token (it can be obtained from your Git Enterprise Server).



  reject_unauthorized (type: bool)
    Reject self-signed certificates. 

    

    Default value: false



  password (type: str)
    Password to authenticate to service on the mainframe.



  cert_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication.

    

    Note: The CLI does not support certificate files that require a password. For more information, search Troubleshooting PEM Certificates in Zowe Docs.



  cert_key_file (type: path)
    The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication.



  response_format_filter (type: list)
    Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single field/property or a list of a single field/property.



  response_format_type (type: str)
    The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

    

    table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a column in the table.

    

    list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry in an array.

    

    object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object). Can be used in place of "table" to change from tabular output to a list of prettified objects.

    

    string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.


    Choices:
      * ``table`` 
      * ``list`` 
      * ``object`` 
      * ``string`` 

  response_format_header (type: bool)
    If "--response-format-type table" is specified, include the column headers in the output.
