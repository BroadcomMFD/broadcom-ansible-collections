Synopsis

Parameters
----------

  element (*required*, type: str)
    The name of the Endevor element that its processor group will be modified.



  processor_group (*required*, type: str)
    The name of the processor group you want to use.

  endevor_subsystem (type: str)
    The Endevor subsystem or alias of the subsystem where your project resides.



  type (type: str)

  response_format_filter (type: list)
    Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single field/property or a list of a single field/property.



  response_format_type (type: str)
    The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

    

    table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a column in the table.

    

    list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry in an array.

    

    object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object). Can be used in place of "table" to change from tabular output to a list of prettified objects.

    

    string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.


    Choices:
      * ``table`` 
      * ``list`` 
      * ``object`` 
      * ``string`` 

  response_format_header (type: bool)
    If "--response-format-type table" is specified, include the column headers in the output.
