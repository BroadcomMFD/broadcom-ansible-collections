|BACMs| provide the ability to connect the mainframe to enterprise automation strategy using the
Ansible ecosystem. This enables automation on the mainframe (configuration management, provisioning, and application
deployment) in a unified and easy-to-use platform.

This solution comes together as a set of Ansible collections that enable
Broadcom mainframe software solutions to be used in Ansible ecosystem.

Each solution is represented in a distribution format known
as collections that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.

You can install and use collections through `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/broadcom>`_.
