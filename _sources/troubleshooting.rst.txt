Problems
========

.. |BACMs| replace:: Broadcom Ansible Collections for Mainframe

.. glossary::

  I am getting the following error: ``Data could not be sent to remote host. Make sure this host can be reached over ssh: Permission denied (publickey,password)``

    **Reason:** Ansible does not have a method for authentication while connecting to the system using SSH.

    **Action:** If your playbook uses only modules like |BACMs|, that connect to z/OS using APIs and do not gather facts from z/OS system,
    specify ``gather_facts: false`` in your playbook. Otherwise you need to setup a method that enables you to authenticate with SSH.
    Review information in :doc:`Connection methods and details <connecting>`.

Diagnostics
===========

When the |BACMs| do not work as expected, you might need to provide more information to support.

You can configure Ansible commands like ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` to provide more verbose messages, using the following options:

- ``-vv`` to display information about the activity of Ansible and modules.
- ``-vvvv`` to display internal details about work of the modules (output of commands, internal variables, and such). Sensitive information, such as user IDs and passwords, is hidden.

Special module arguments
========================

.. glossary::

  ``_skip_parameter_checks``
  
     If you set this argument to `True``,  it disables argument checks that are done by |BACMs|. This can help if a check is too rigid and does not allow a value that should be accepted.
